# HTTP Load Balancer in Go

A Layer 7 (HTTP) load balancer implementation that distributes incoming HTTP requests across multiple backend servers. Features include round-robin load balancing, health checks, and dynamic backend management.

## Features

- âœ¨ Layer 7 (HTTP) Load Balancing
- ðŸ”„ Round Robin Algorithm
- ðŸ’“ Active Health Checks
- ðŸš¦ Dynamic Backend Management
- ðŸŽ® Control Interface for Backend States
- ðŸ“Š Request Distribution Logging

### Package Descriptions

- `cmd/server`: Main application that starts the load balancer and test backends
- `cmd/control`: Tool to control backend states (failure simulation, delays)
- `cmd/test-client`: Tool to generate test traffic

- `internal/core/backend`: Backend server management
  - Handles both real and test backend implementations
  - Manages health checks and server states
  - Implements proxy forwarding

- `internal/core/balancer`: Load balancing logic
  - Implements round-robin selection
  - Manages backend pool
  - Handles request distribution

- `internal/utils/logger`: Shared logging utilities
  - Color-coded log output
  - Different log levels for different operations
  - Clear distinction between health checks and client requests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24 or higher

### Running the Load Balancer

1. Start the load balancer with test backends:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```
This will start:
- Load balancer on port 8080
- Three test backends on ports 8081, 8082, and 8083

2. Control backend states (in another terminal):
```bash
# Make a backend fail
go run cmd/control/main.go -port 8081 -fail=true

# Add delay to a backend
go run cmd/control/main.go -port 8082 -delay=1s

# Recover a failed backend
go run cmd/control/main.go -port 8081 -fail=false
```

3. Test with sample traffic (in another terminal):
```bash
# Send 10 requests, 3 at a time
go run cmd/test-client/main.go -n 10 -c 3

# Rapid-fire test with 100 requests
go run cmd/test-client/main.go -n 100 -c 10 -i 10ms
```

## How It Works

1. **Load Balancing**: 
   - Round-robin algorithm distributes requests
   - Only healthy backends receive traffic
   - Dynamic backend pool management

2. **Health Checks**: 
   - Regular health checks every 2 seconds
   - Automatic backend removal on failure
   - Automatic recovery when backend is healthy

3. **Request Flow**:
   ```
   Client â†’ Load Balancer â†’ Backend Selection â†’ Health Check â†’ Forward Request
                                            â†³ Error if no healthy backends
   ```

4. **Logging**:
   - Color-coded for different operations:
     - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Successful health checks
     - ðŸ”´ Red: Failed health checks
     - ðŸ”µ Blue: Client requests
     - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Load balancer operations

## Development

To add new features or modify existing ones:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DevBajaj02/load-balancer.git
cd load-balancer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Make changes and test:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```
